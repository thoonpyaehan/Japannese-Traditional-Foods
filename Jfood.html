                        <p> If you like offal and hot pot, then you’re going to love this Fukuoka specialty. Motsunabe is a Japanese hot pot stew made with beef or pork offal. Beef intestines are most common though other types of offal can also be used.
                        Motsunabe is usually cooked in a shallow hot pot on your table. The offal is allowed to simmer for a few minutes in a soup base seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and chili pepper. Other ingredients like cabbage, garlic chives, and champon noodles are later added to complete the dish. 
                        Motsunabe hot pot tastes delicious, especially when eaten with rice. It’s one of the best things you can do in Fukuoka. I haven't tried it before at all but people usually recommend the highly regarded Hakata Motsunabe Yamanaka Akasakaten restaurant.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p> Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish and the first thing people think of when they think of Japanese cuisine. For sushi connoisseurs, it’s more than just food. It’s an art form.Sushi refers to a family of artfully presented dishes made with vinegared sushi rice and a variety of ingredients, mostly raw fish and other types of seafood. It can be made with any type of fresh raw fish, some of the most popular being maguro (tuna), shake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), and unagi (freshwater eel).Sushi is commonly eaten with pickled ginger and dipped in soy sauce mixed with wasabi.Sushi was invented in Japan as a way of preserving raw fish by storing it in fermented rice. This early type of sushi is known as narezushi and can still be enjoyed in Japan today.Pictured below is kabura zushi, a more modern type of narezushi associated with Kanazawa. It’s a Kanazawa food specialty made with salted buri (Japanese amberjack or yellowtail) sandwiched between pieces of pickled turnip.More common types of sushi in Japan include maki sushi, nigiri sushi, chirashizushi, and inari sushi. Non-Japanese people are probably most familiar with nigiri sushi and maki sushi.Nigiri sushi refers to oblong-shaped rice balls topped with a sliver of fish and other types of seafood, while maki sushi is the type of sushi commonly referred to as “sushi rolls”. You can see examples of both in the picture above. </p>

                        <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup made with dashi, miso paste, and any number of optional ingredients like vegetables, tofu, abura-age (deep-fried tofu pouches), fish, and seafood. It’s a Japanese food staple that’s served with many set meals in Japan. Personally, miso soup is my favorite dish to eat at the end of a Japanese meal. I prefer it over anything, even dessert. Not only is it delicious, but it’s good for you as well. It’s made with fermented soybeans which is considered a type of health food in Japan.</p>

                        <p> Sashimi refers to thinly sliced raw fish or seafood. It can even refer to different types of raw meat. It’s basically sushi minus the vinegared rice. Like sushi, it’s usually eaten with soy sauce mixed with wasabi.It isn’t fish but pictured below is one of my favorite types of sashimi – uni or sea urchin sashimi. Often served in its own shell, I had this golden glistening bowl at Kuromon Ichiba Market in Osaka but you can pretty much find uni sushi and sashimi at any seafood market in Japan.Spoiler alert, the sashimi below isn’t made with fish either. If you’re a daring eater, then you may want to try chicken sashimi. </p>

                        <p> Tempura is a traditional Japanese cooking method that involves deep-frying seafood or vegetables coated in a light batter made with cold water and soft cake flour. The tempura batter is lightly mixed and kept cold with lumps to create a crisp and fluffy texture when fried.Most tempura is cooked for just a few seconds before being served with grated daikon radish and a dipping sauce, most often tentsuyu which is made with dashi (soup stock), mirin (rice wine), and shoyu (soy sauce). Alternatively, it can be sprinkled with sea salt or mixtures of powdered green tea, salt, and yuzu before eating.Different types of fish, seafood, and vegetables are used to make tempura in Japan though ebi (shrimp) is the most popular.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p> Curry rice is hugely popular in Japan. It was introduced to Japan by the British during the Meiji period but it wasn’t until the late 1960s that it exploded in popularity when it became widely available at supermarkets and Japanese restaurants.Today, Japanese curry rice is considered by many to be a national dish of Japan. It’s available throughout the country and commonly served over rice, over udon, and in savory Japanese pastries.  A Japanese curry meal typically consists of curry sauce, rice, and different types of meat and vegetables like carrots, onions, and potatoes. Pork, beef, and chicken curry are the most common though it can be made with other meats as well.Pictured above is a less common horse meat katsu curry (deep-fried breaded cutlet) from Kumamoto. We enjoyed it at Warokuya restaurant in Kurokawa Onsen. Kumamoto and Nagano are among the few prefectures in Japan known for farming horse meat.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p> The two dishes that are most representative of Osaka food culture are takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Both are frequently labeled as street food but in our opinion, only takoyaki should be considered true Japanese street food.<br>
                        Takoyaki refers to a gooey ball-shaped snack made from wheat flour batter filled with chopped octopus, scraps of tempura, pickled ginger, and green onion. It’s usually topped with a sweet and savory takoyaki sauce along with Japanese mayo, green laver, and bonito flakes.<br>
                        Like okonomiyaki, takoyaki stands are ubiquitous in Osaka. But unlike okonomiyaki, takoyaki is easy to eat and just as frequently enjoyed outside of the traditional restaurant setting. Takoyaki was first popularized in Osaka, where a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo is credited with its invention in 1935. Takoyaki was inspired by akashiyaki, a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hyōgo Prefecture made of an egg-rich batter and octopus.</p>

                        <p>They were first introduced in 1598, at a grand banquet known as the Daigo no Hanami held by the notorious warlord, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Revelers would enjoy imperial court music called gagaku, and poetry. Dango refers to a street food snack consisting of skewered rice dumplings made from uruchi and glutinous rice flour. It has a chewy mochi-like consistency and can be covered in different coatings and glazes. There are many different types of dango but one of the most popular is mitarashi dango. It’s covered in a sweet-savory glaze made with soy sauce, sugar, and starch. Other popular types of dango include hanami dango (three-colored dango), kinako dango (dusted with roasted soy flour), and anko dango (covered with red bean paste). Depending on what it’s coated with, some types of dango are often enjoyed with green tea. They’re also popular as a dessert or snack, or as festival food. Pictured below is miso dango from the popular Ohagi no Tambaya chain. As its name suggests, it’s covered in a delicious miso glaze.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Okonomiyaki was invented in Japan prior to World War II and evolved and became popular during and after the war. The earliest origins of a basic crepe-like pancake date back to the Edo period (1683-1868) period where these were a special desert served at Buddhist ceremonies called Funoyaki.<br>
                          The origin of okonomiyaki dates back to the mid-16th century, when Sen no Rikyū, a master of the tea ceremony, served a cake called fu no yaki, which was made from flour mixed with water. This mixture was then cooked and miso paste seasoned with a little pepper was added.<br>
                          The Japanese will often tell you that this griddle-fried dish is a “Japanese savory pancake,” or something along those lines, but that doesn’t quite fully describe it. Okonomiyaki is made from an egg-and-flour batter mixed with cabbage and fried. Other ingredients can also be added according to regional recipes and your personal taste (in fact, okonomi literally translates to "preference"). These can include pork belly, kimchi, various vegetables, and usually a topping of dried bonito fish flakes, mayonnaise, and special okonomiyaki sauce. </p>

                        <p> Onigiri (お握り or 御握り), also known as omusubi (お結び), nigirimeshi (握り飯), or rice ball is my go-to konbini snack. If I want something quick and easy to eat that won’t fill me up too much, then I’ll usually go with onigiri. You can usually find them easily in convenience stores. <br>
                            Onigiri refers to a popular Japanese snack made with white rice, nori, and some type of filling. They’re called rice balls though they often come in triangular and cylindrical shapes as well. Typical onigiri fillings include tuna, salmon, umeboshi (pickled Japanese plum), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), mentaiko (pollock roe), and kombu (kelp), though they can be filled with any salty or sour ingredient that can be used as a natural preservative. <br>
                            In spite of its name and its appearance, onigiri isn’t a form of sushi. Sushi is made with vinegared rice while onigiri is made with unseasoned white rice.

                        <p>  Like imagawayaki, taiyaki are pancake-like snacks filled with sweet azuki bean paste. They’re made in a fish-shaped mold resembling tai (red seabream), hence the name taiyaki. <br>
                        Taiyaki is commonly filled with sweetened azuki beans though they can be made with other fillings as well like custard, chocolate, cheese, and sweet potato. It’s basically a fish-shaped version of imagawayaki, but with a different texture. <br>
                        Taiyaki is one of the most popular Japanese street food snacks. Tai is considered a symbol of good luck so you can find taiyaki pretty much anywhere in Japan.

                        <p>Mochi is one of the most well-known Japanese sweets. It refers to a popular Japanese rice cake made from mochigome, a glutinous short-grain rice. The rice is pounded into a paste before being molded into the desired shape.Mochi can be enjoyed year-round in Japan though it’s traditionally eaten to usher in the Japanese New Year. It’s often eaten on its own but it can also be used as an ingredient in many products like confections and ice cream. Apart from attracting good fortune, it’s believed that long strands of freshly made mochi symbolize a long life and good well-being.<br>
                        If you visit Japan in spring, then be sure to look out for a special type of pink mochi called sakuramochi. It’s made to welcome spring in Japan and is filled with a sweet red bean paste and wrapped in a pickled cherry blossom leaf.Mochi is traditionally made in a labor-intensive process called mochitsuki. The steamed rice is pounded with a heavy wooden mallet (kine) in a large mortar (usu).<br>
                        Two people work in tandem – one pounds while the other turns and wets the mochi. They have to keep a steady rhythm so as not to crush the mochi-wetter’s hand with the heavy kine! </p>

                        <p>Castella is a Japanese sponge cake made with sugar, flour, eggs, and starch syrup. It was brought to Japan by Portuguese merchants in the 16th century through Nagasaki, which at the time was the only Japanese port open to foreign commerce.<br>
                        Today, castella cake is considered a specialty of Nagasaki, its name derived from the Portuguese dish Pao de Castela meaning “bread from Castile”.<br>
                        Castella cake is available at many shops in the city and is one of Nagasaki’s most popular tourist gift items. We bought a few boxes at popular Castella chain Bunmeido.</p>

                        <p>Hokkaido is the biggest prefecture in Japan and home to a massive dairy industry. They produce about half of the country’s milk and 90% of its cheese.Dairy from Hokkaido is more expensive than dairy from other prefectures because of its reputation for quality and freshness. It’s so highly regarded that you’ll often find labels on packages proudly showing they were made with Hokkaido dairy.<br>
                        This is true even outside of Japan. Many dessert and pastry shops in Asia will often create and highlight products made with Hokkaido dairy.There are terrific dairy products everywhere in Hokkaido but the best we found were in Otaru, a small port city less than an hour northwest of Sapporo. You can try it in Japanese pastries, cookies, custard, and other desserts, though the most popular is soft serve ice cream.<br>
                        Take a stroll down Sakaimachi Street and sample goodies at its many dairy shops. Be sure to stop at the hugely popular LeTao to pick up one of these double fromage cheeseckaes. It’s insanely delicious.</p>

                        <p>Soft cream is what the Japanese call soft serve ice cream. It’s creamier and thicker than your average soft serve and is perhaps the single most popular street food snack on this list. It’s available everywhere in Japan, from rest stops to markets to festivals and convenience stores.Japan, especially Hokkaido, is known for its dairy industry which is why Japanese soft cream is so good. It’s delicious everywhere in Japan but especially in Hokkaido. No trip to Sapporo can ever be complete without indulging in soft cream and other Hokkaido milk products.<br>
                        Pictured below is the terrific Uji matcha soft cream I enjoyed at Kyoto’s Nishiki Market.<br>
                        Is this the most decadent cone of soft serve you’ve sever seen? This gold leaf soft cream was from the Hakuichi shop in Kanazawa, a city known for producing 99% of Japan’s high-quality gold leaf. Talk about boujee!</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Matcha is an important part of Japanese culture. It refers to a finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea leaves.Traditionally, matcha is mixed with hot water to make tea. It’s the central component in Japanese tea ceremonies which revolve around the preparation, serving, and drinking of matcha as hot tea. The Japanese drink it often as it’s touted to have many health benefits.<br>
                        Pictured below is a cup of matcha with wagashi from an informal tea ceremony I enjoyed in Kanazawa. Wagashi are carefully crafted traditional Japanese sweets or confections that are usually served with green tea. Considered an art form in Japan, it comes in many shaped and can be made with a diverse array of ingredients and preparation methods.The best matcha in Japan is said to come from Uji, a small town between Kyoto and Nara. The highest grade of matcha is referred to as ceremonial-grade matcha and is the type used in Japanese tea ceremonies.<br>
                        Matcha may be the central component in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies but the ingredient has found its way into many modern dishes as well. Culinary-grade matcha is used to flavor a spectrum of trendy food products in Japan like mochi, ice cream, chocolates, candy, lattes, cakes, and pastries. It’s even used to flavor savory Japanese dishes like soba and tempura.</p>

                        <p>Sake is the national beverage of Japan. It refers to an alcoholic drink made by fermenting rice that’s been polished to remove the bran.Sake is referred to as Japanese rice wine though its brewing process is actually closer to beer than wine. Like beer, sake is produced by converting starch into sugars which ferment into alcohol.<br>
                        I went on a sake tasting tour in Kyoto’s Fushimi district and I was fascinated by the process. Like wine, you can pair different types of sake with certain dishes to bring out the flavor and character of the sake and food.If you’d like to learn more about sake in Kyoto, then you can book a sake tasting tour through Magical Trip.<br>
